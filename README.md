# Citibikes--Better than Uber!

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis was to illustrate the use of Citibikes, bikes people rent on a per use basis. My goal was to examine how often the bikes are being checked out, what times they are being used and the user demographic of the riders in order to see if De Moines, Iowa could potentially match that demographic.

## Results
During the intial analysis, I first sorted the most active bike riding times for New York City. Surpisingly, the peak hours for Citibike usage was around 12 AM. This could be attributed to the fact that many people are having a night out, likely bar hopping. Instead of using ride-sharing applications like Uber or Lyft, which is more expensive but also time consuming due to traffic, this could mean people are opting to bike instead to their next destination.

After creating a graph of the users information collected, I found that during those peak times, men made up the majority of the bike riders. There were nearly 75,000 more male riders than female ones. This doesnt surprise me for two reasons, men generally feel safer on a bike late at night than a woman would and usually are, as well as women often wear clothing that would not allow them to comfortably ride a bike (dress, heels etc).

During the week, I noticed the trend of bike usage around the working hours. Many more bikes were checked out around the time to commute to work, and commute home from work. There was still a steady stream of bike rides in between the workday.

Once again I found that there were more male users during this time too. Male users made up double if not more than the amount of female users.

Citibikes offers a per usage rental as well as a subscription rental option. Through my analysis, Citibikes customer base is largely subscription. This is really good for the company as people are continuously using and paying a regular fee to use the bikes. Men once again made up the majority of the subscriber count.

Citibikes has bikes scattered all around Mahattan. After analyzing the data for where bike trips are started, most of them orginate in Manhattan.

Ending locations of bike rides also found to be concluding in Manhattan. This means most users live in the area and use the bikes to get around for their daily life.

## Summary
It is without question that the Citibikes are very popular in New York City. The bikes offer a convenient way to get around the city while avoidiing traffic, more efficiently than walking, and less of hassle of having/storing a personally owned bike. Citibikes has a large male subscriber demographic, who use the bikes for not only commuting to work, but for nights out. 
In order to know if Citibikes would be able to thrive in Des Moines, we would have to analyze how closely everything is located. In urban Manhattan, the city is large yes, but many thing are within walking distance so that a bike ride is feasible and won't take many miles to reach the destination. No one in Manhattan is regularly biking 40 miles.
We need to see DeMoines populated areas, the businesses and homes/apartments. That way we can see if people might want to ride a bike instead of drive. We also would need to see if DeMoines has an active night life scene. Peak usage was at midnight for New York City, so if DeMoines has fun scene too (for Iowa), users could potentially use the bikes to get to their next destination as well.
